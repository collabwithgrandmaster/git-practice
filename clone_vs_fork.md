## Definitions

- <b>Clone</b>: a local copy of a Git repository on your machine; done with git clone <url>. It's just copying the repo data and setting a remote named origin.
- <b>Fork</b>: a remote copy of a repo under your account on a hosting service (GitHub/GitLab). Forking is done on the website (or via API) — not a built-in Git command — and gives you your own writable copy of the project.
